[http-status-codes]
== HTTP status codes

[%header]
|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
  The actual response will depend on the request method used.

 - In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
 - In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

| `204 No Content`
| The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
